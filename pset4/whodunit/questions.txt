1.  What’s stdint.h?
stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that allows  programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs
that specify exact-width integer types, along with the defined min and max values for each type, using macros.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
These are unsigned and signed integer types from stdint.h. Using well-defined types makes the code far easier and safer to port since you
won't get any surprises when one machine interprets int as 16-bit and another as 32-bit. What you type is what you get when you use them.

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
1 byte in a BYTE
4 bytes in a DWORD (32 bits)
4 bytes in a LONG (32 bits)
2 bytes in a WORD (16 bits)

4.What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
 The first two bytes of any BMP file must contain ASCII B then ASCII M.

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
 bfSize is the size of the bmp file. biSize is the size of the structure. Both in bytes.

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
If biHeight is postive, the image is bottom up. If biHeight is negative, the image is bottom down.

7.   What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth - the number of bits per pixel.

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
fopen might return a NULL pointer if the file that fopen is trying to
write to doesn't exist.

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
fread's third argument is always 1 because we are iterating over every
pixel.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
If biWidth is 3:
int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = 3.
This step ensures the number of bytes in every row is a multiple of 4.

11. What does fseek do?
fseek allows us to change the offset of a pointer.

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
SEEK_CUR is the current position indicator in the file.
