0. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
    Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis refers to a lung disease that is otherwise known as silicosis. It is the longestword in the 
    English language published in a dictionary.
    
1. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
    getrusage returns resource usage measures for "int who", which is always RUSAGE_SELF in speller.c.
    Specifying RUSAGE_SELF returns resource usage statistics for the calling process, which is the sum of resources used 
    by all threads in the process.
    
2. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
    There are 16 members in a variable of type struct rusage. They are also listed on this page: http://linux.die.net/man/2/getrusage.
    
3. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
    We pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to the function "calculate" because passing large structs by value is slow
    and takes up a lot of memory. If you're passing or returning structs by value, 
    copies of those structs will get placed on the stack, potentially causing stack overflow.
    
4. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. 
   In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works?
    The key aspect of the for loop is the c = fgetc(fp) function call. fgetc gets the next character (an unsigned char) from fp and advances the 
    position indicator in fp until the end of the file (EOF) is reached. As each character is received, 
    it is put through an if(if)-elseif-elseif logical sequence. Summarizing the sequence: 
    1) If the character is an alphabetical character or an apostrophe that is not at index 0 of the 
    word, the character is appended to the word array. 2) Else if the character is numerical, the word is ignored and we skip ahead to the 
    next word (which is found after a space). 3) Else if we hit a space or punctuation, we must have found a whole word so we terminate the word by
    adding \0 to the word array.
5. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read
   whole words at  a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
        fscanf with a format string like "%s" will read subsequent characters 
        until a whitespace is found (whitespace characters are considered to be 
        blank, newline and tab). Because words within the txt files sometimes 
        end with punctuation, fscanf will view them as being part of the word, 
        which complicates the reading procedure. In addition, if a longer string
        than expected was read using fscanf (e.g. a jibberish string like asdfba
        asdkdfawemflkasciaoeufalkesfasldkfjaoiwefjaslkdmcalksdfiwoefalskdfamsdcl
        asdflkasdlkmceaasdfasdf..., which could be included in a text file from
        a malicious source that is trying to break our program), we could 
        overwrite important data in memory or cause a segmentation fault.

6.  Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
    With const char* parameter, we prevent changes to the string that parameter is pointing at through parameter (i.e. const pointers prevent 
    changing the data pointed to)/ The parameters for check (const char* word) and load (const char* dictionary)
    are declared as const pointers because we want to prevent changes to a read word and the dictionary we are using.
